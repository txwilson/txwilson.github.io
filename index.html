                I am someone who strives to be the best I can be at everything I do. I grew up playing sports and that made me very competitive.
                I am an avid Bengals and Reds fan, but more importantly, an Ohio State Buckeye fan. Just ask my dog, Zeke, who was named after the MVP of the 2014 national championship team.
                As for my other qualities, instead of trying to describe myself, I asked people close to me. These are the words they felt represented who I am.<br />

                I became interested in programming during high school. My school offered a beginner's level programming class, so I decided to take it for fun.
                It turned out, I wasn't half bad at this programming thing. So I get to Ball State University and what do I major in...yes, criminal justice.

                My dream is to be in the military, however, being a type 1 diabetic I'm not able to carry out that dream.
                I thought being a police officer would be the next best thing. But, as I sat in those criminal justice classes, I felt the information was repetitive
                and I wasn't being challenged. I needed a creative outlet so to keep my mind entertained, I found myself coding. At first I taught myself through tutorials
                online and started making simple games. I realized programming was a much better fit for me than criminal justice.

                Junior year of college, I finally decided to change my major to computer science. I could now, hopefully, help make people's lives easier. And I could do
                this while using my creativity and problem solving skills that I feel would have been not used to their full potential in the criminal justice field. That's
                what got me here today, a soon-to-be computer science graduate, ready to help and create.
